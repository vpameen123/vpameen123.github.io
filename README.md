## ABOUT MYSELF
Myself Mohammed Ameen VP, a 4th year engineering student from Kondotty, Malappuram. I currently pursue Electrical and Electronics Engineering at MESCE, Kuttippuram. I completed my secondary schooling from PKMMHS Edarikode.

As a short term goal, I am looking for an opportunity to grow my career with a reputed organization. My vision in life is to make something big in life and bring laurels to the organization I work with. I believe that there is something to learn from everyone and that is my biggest strength. I like to take up challenges and take the lesson from my mistakes. I am a perfectionist and I strive for excellence. 
 
## FABLAB TRAINING
This session deals with the details and progress of the FabLab course conducted in our college from Thursday, 3rd August 2017. This course gives an introductory knowledge to the students about FabLab and the application of it in the academic engineering and project prototyping. The class is conducted by FabLab division of MESCE, Kuttippuram and is lead by Mr. Muhammed Jaseel.

### INTRODUCTION TO FABLAB
A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything”. This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.

Neil A. Gershenfeld (born 1959 or 1960) is an American professor at MIT and the director of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms, a sister lab to the MIT Media Lab. His research studies are predominantly focused in interdisciplinary studies involving physics and computer science, in such fields as quantum computing, nanotechnology, and personal fabrication.He is considered as Father Of FAB LAB. 

### COURSE PROGRESS

- **FABLAB DAY 1**

 The course is conducted by the FabLab section of MESCE and was commenced on 2nd August 2017 Wednesday. The course is lead by Mr. Muhammed Jaseel. By the end of the day, simple assignments were given to the students, like creating acounts in GitHub, GrabCAD, Thingiverse, Instrucables etc.
 
- **FABLAB DAY 2**

We got an idea about How to Document our Work Properly and had a session about Github Page creation. DEatiled study was carried out about CNC, 3D Printing and Cura.

### COURSE TERMINOLOGY

- **CNC**

Computer numerical control (CNC) is the automation of machine tools by means of computers executing pre-programmed sequences of machine control commands.This is in contrast to machines that are manually controlled by hand wheels or levers, or mechanically automated by cams alone

- **3D PRINTING**

The term "3D printing" originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer. More recently, the term is being used in popular vernacular to encompass a wider variety of additive manufacturing techniques. United States and global technical standards use the official term additive manufacturing for this broader sense. ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of AM processes within its meaning: binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination and vat photopolymerization.

- **CURA**

Cura prepares your model for 3D printing. For novices, it makes it easy to get great results. For experts, there are over 200 settings to adjust to your needs. As it’s open source, our community helps enrich it even more.
